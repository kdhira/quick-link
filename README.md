# Quick Link
This is a mini-project that has the purpose of showing links to webpages all in one place (like a dashboard).

## Installation
1. Install Jekyll.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Add files \_includes/header.htm and \_includes/footer.htm
    - Optionally add contents to these files if you want a header and/or footer
      to your page.
4. Look at \_data/links/example.yml. This is an example/template of how to add
   links and categories to the page. You can edit this file, or make another
   .yml file. Jekyll will consider all .yml files in this directory (in
   alphabetical order) when building/serving the page.
5. Modify \_config.yml and change the name of the site.
6. Run `jekyll serve` and navigate to the URL that Jekyll says to. You could
   also just do a `jekyll build` and export the \_site directory (this is the
   generated static website).
